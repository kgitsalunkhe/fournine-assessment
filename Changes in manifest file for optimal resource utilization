To optimize resource utilization and address the memory consumption issue in the mischievous-deployment, you can make the following changes to the manifest file:


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mischievous-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "50m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"

Adjust the values according to your application's requirements and the available resources in your cluster

We can add readiness and liveness probes to ensure that the mischievous-deployment is healthy.
